# Todo List App by Miguel


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

The Todo List application is implemented in swift 5.0, with the ability to create, read, update, and delete tasks on the go. 









### Tech/Dependencies

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [cocoapods] - A dependency manager for Swift
* [Swift] - A development framework for iOS apps
* [Xcode] - The IDE for iOS development

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

1. Install the dependencies -> [cocoapods]
2. Download the zip file, and extract folder.

Building and running the application
```sh
$ cd MiguelTodoList/TodoListApp
$ pod install
## you can either open xcode from terminal
$ xed . 
## or open the workspace from xcode itself
```
